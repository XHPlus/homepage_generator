Ruihao Gong is currently a senior researcher at SenseTime. Before this, he studied at Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. [Xianglong Liu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~xlliu/). Since 2017, he worked on the build-up of computer vision systems and model quantization as an intern at Sensetime Research, where he enjoyed working with the talented researchers and grew up a lot with the help of [Fengwei Yu](http://forwil.xyz/), [Wei Wu](https://wuwei-ai.org/), [Jing Shao](https://amandajshao.github.io/), and [Junjie Yan](https://yan-junjie.github.io/). During the early time of the internship, he independently took responsibility for the development of intelligent video analysis system Sensevideo. Later, he started the research on model quantization which can speed up the inference and even the training of neural networks on edge devices. Now he is devoted to further promoting the accuracy of extremely low-bit models and the auto-deployment of quantized models.
